# WAVS-EAS

This is a an example that integrates Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) with verifiable offchain applications powered by WAVS.

This allows for AVSs to make attestations and perform computations over attestation graphs.

TODO:
- Convert eas-contracts-examples Tests to solidity
- Deploy scripts
- Simple UI to make attestations

WAVS Component Examples:
- An WAVS AVS that can make attestations
- A WAVS AVS that performs computations over attestations
- Composing botth together (i.e. a WAVS AVS that performs computations over attestations and makes attestations)
